### üìÑDescription
---
In this project our aim is to predict the `flight price` , the `duration` and the `travel time` using machine learning models. User has to input the name of the city(`source`) that they want to depart from and the destination.In addition to that user has to enter their `airline name` which is pretty important , their `departure time` and `departure date` and at last the user has to enter the total number of stoppages during flight. At the end, the model return three values; `price`, `travel time` and the `arrival time`.

### ‚≠ïChallenges & Limitations
---
Although this project seems simple and straightforward, but you may face diverse challenges when you solve this problem. First of all the dataset contains about 10 features. In the first step you have to preprocess and analyse all of the features which is very time consuming. i.e the dataset contains the `date format` which is in a raw format and you have to split it into multiple comlumns(i.e. day, weekday, month, season, etc.) , in the next step you have to map some string to their corresponding values for further analysis(i.e. map the `summer` to the `3` or map `spring` to the `2` and etc.). In addition to that the dataset suffering from multiple issues and limitations. i.e. outliers and number of records that available in the dataset.

In terms of featuer engineering, this dataset contains various features from various formats. Some featuers are `continuous` and some of them are `categorical`.For some of the caxtegorical features that had some values `One-Hot-Encoding` was used and some of them which contains many more values `count/frequency` feature encoding was used(to prevent `the curse of dimensionality`). The new challenge we may face in this project is that we have to apply `cyclical` feature encoding to some features that have cyclical attribute.i.e `weekday` and `day` features have cyclical attribute('Monday' and `Sunday` have the same distance as 'Wednesday' and `Thursday`) so to improve the model performance it is better to apply cyclical feature encoding on these kind of features.

Another important thing to note is that, the `Arrival_Time` and `Duration` feature are considered as output features in addition to `price`. In spite of these two features have high predctive power and their removal can effect the model performance, but the user itself can not evaluate or guesse it properly. Because of that these two feature removed from the input.

### üìêModel Performance
---
For this project, Random Forest Regressor is used. In spite of good results that this algorithm can produce, its creation and validation was a little bit challenging. This is because many hyperparameters have to be defined to Random Forest to fits on them and this takes some time. After that Cross-Validation is applied and the best, worst, and the mean of mean squared error(mse) is calculated and reported.The more informations about the model's performance is available in the `Model Creation & Validation.ipynb`
The model is saved by pickle format and you can access it by `model` folder.
